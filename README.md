## Game Rules
There are nine paddles numebrs 1 through 9. The goal of the game is to roll the dice and flip over all of the paddles to spell out the word "\*JACKPOT\*". 

When you roll the dice you can filp over at the most one paddle. You can:
- Flip over the number that corresponds to one of the dice
- Flip over the number that corresponds to the sum of the two dice. 
- If the paddle has already been flipped over you cannot flip it again.

Example: 

die 1: 4, die 2: 3

You can flip over 3 or 4 or 7. If any of those have already been flipped you cannot re-flip it. 

If you have no legal move the game is over and you have lost. 

If you are able to flip over all of the paddles, spelling out "\*JACKPOT\*" the game is over and you have won.
